    <p class="p1"><span>P</span>erfume is a mixture of fragrant essential oils and aroma compounds, fixatives, and solvents used to
        give the human body, objects, and living spaces a pleasant smell.Perfume comes from the Latin “per”
        meaning “through” and “fumum,” or “smoke.”</p>
    <p class="p2">Many ancient perfumes were made by extracting
        natural oils from plants through pressing and steaming. The oil was then burned to scent the air. Today,
        most perfume is used to scent bar soaps. Some products are even perfumed with industrial odorants to
        mask unpleasant smells or to appear “unscented.”</p>
